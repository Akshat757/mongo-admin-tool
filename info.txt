database -> collection -> document

database: 
    add a new database, must add a collection with it too

collection:
    add a collection:
        give collection name

document:
    add data:
        to add data we should use json format like - 
            {
                "id" : kl3a245jn15vkajn ,
                "name" : "john" ,
                "location" : "India"
            }
            (id is given by mongo itself)
            (there is no schema in mongo as it is noSQL i.e. data in a document all need not have same fields)
